## Rollback Guidance

If you encounter issues after migration:

1. Revert to previous DSL version in your blueprints
2. Use previous adapter version: `npm install @automation-blueprints/adapters@0.1.0`
3. Report the issue on GitHub with details

---

## Best Practices

1. **Version Pin**: Pin DSL schema version in your blueprints (`"dslVersion": "0.1.0"`)
2. **Test Before Production**: Always test migrated blueprints in sandbox
3. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate blueprints incrementally, not all at once
4. **Keep Backups**: Maintain backups of blueprints before migration
5. **Review Changelogs**: Read CHANGELOG before upgrading
